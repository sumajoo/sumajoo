## About Me

Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Sumajoo**, a medical student **and** software developer. I combine my passion for medicine with programming to create solutions that make a real-world impact. For example, I developed **MedStats**, an iOS app that helps aspiring medical students prepare for the MedAT exam by tracking their practice results and providing detailed analytics.

Driven by a passion for education, I build **data-driven study tools** that help studentsâ€”especially future physiciansâ€”learn smarter and stay motivated. I'm always keen to take on new challenges where I can blend my medical background with software craftsmanship to create engaging learning experiences.

## Tech Stack Overview

My projects span multiple languages and frameworks, with a focus on modern, high-level tools. I primarily use **Python** for data analysis and visualization, **JavaScript/TypeScript** (Next.js/React) for web development, **React Native/Expo** for cross-platform mobile apps, and **Swift** for native iOS development. Across my repositories, youâ€™ll notice a preference for declarative UI frameworks (like **SwiftUI**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Expo Router**) and rich user experiences (animations via **Framer Motion**, **Reanimated**, icon libraries, etc.). Below is a breakdown by language, highlighting the key libraries and frameworks I rely on and their purpose.

### Python (Data Analysis & Scripting)

* **Streamlit** â€“ Build interactive dashboards / data apps (e.g. HomeTemp UI).
* **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation and analysis (sensor data, CSVs, etc.).
* **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computing, statistics, correlations.
* **Matplotlib** â€“ Custom charts and visualizations (temperature trends, etc.).
* **Requests** â€“ Fetch external data from web APIs.

### JavaScript/TypeScript (Web Development)

* **Next.js 13** â€“ React framework with App Router for SSR/ISR and routing (MedStats landing page).
* **TypeScript** â€“ Static typing for reliability and maintainability.
* **React** â€“ Core UI library for interactive components.
* **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first styling for rapid design.
* **Framer Motion** â€“ Smooth animations and transitions.
* **Lucide Icons** â€“ Consistent, crisp SVG icon set.
* **shadcn/ui** â€“ Pre-built Radix/Tailwind components (dialogs, buttons, etc.).

### React Native & Expo (Cross-Platform Mobile)

* **Expo SDK 52** â€“ Managed workflow for building and deploying React Native apps.
* **React Native** â€“ Core framework for iOS & Android apps.
* **Expo Router** â€“ File-based routing/navigation for Expo projects.
* **React Navigation** â€“ Stack & tab navigation (`@react-navigation/native`, `bottom-tabs`).
* **React Native Reanimated + Gesture Handler** â€“ High-performance animations and gestures.
* **Async Storage** â€“ On-device keyâ€“value storage.
* **Axios** â€“ Promise-based HTTP client for API calls.
* **Expo Notifications** â€“ Push and local notifications.
* **React Native SVG (+ SVG Transformer)** â€“ Render and inline SVG graphics.
* **React Native WebView** â€“ Embed web content within the app.
* **React Native IAP** â€“ In-app purchases for monetization.

### Swift (iOS App Development)

* **SwiftUI** â€“ Declarative UI framework for building native interfaces.
* **SwiftData** â€“ Modern persistence layer for data modeling and storage.
* **Charts** â€“ Appleâ€™s Swift Charts framework for data visualization.
* **Combine** â€“ Reactive programming for state management.
* **UserNotifications** â€“ Schedule and handle local notifications.
* **UIKit** â€“ Used selectively for haptics or system UI integration.
* **StoreKit** â€“ Request App Store ratings/reviews.
* **WidgetKit** â€“ Create home-screen widgets that surface stats.
